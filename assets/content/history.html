                <h3 style="text-align: left;">Bali History</h3>
                <span>
                <p>The history of Bali covers a period from the Paleolithic to the present, and is characterized by migrations
                    of people
                    and cultures from other parts of Asia. </p>
                <p>In the 16th century, the history of Bali started to be marked by Western influence with the arrival of
                    Europeans, to
                    become, after a long and difficult colonial period under the Dutch, an example of the preservation of
                    traditional
                    cultures and a key
                    tourist destination.</p>
               <img src="/assets/img/bali-history1.jpg" class="featured-image" alt="bali history">
                <p>Bali being part of the Sunda shelf, the island had been connected to the island of Java many times through
                    history.
                    Even today, the two islands are only separated by a 2.4 km Bali Strait. </p>
                <p>The ancient occupation of Java itself is accredited by the findings of the Java man, dated between 1.7 and
                    0.7
                    million years old, one of the first known specimens of Homo erectus.</p>
                <p>Bali also was inhabited in Paleolithic times (1 my BCE to 200.000 BCE), testified by the finding of ancient
                    tools
                    such as hand axes were found in Sembiran and Trunyan villages in Bali. </p>
                <p>A Mesolithic period (200.000-30.000 BCE) has also been identified, characterized by advanced food gathering
                    and
                    hunting, but still by Homo Erectus. </p>
                <h4>Neolithic: Austronesian migrations (3000-600 BCE)</h4>
                <p>From around 3000 to 600 BCE, a Neolithic culture emerges, characterized by a new wave of inhabitants bringing
                    rice-growing technology and speaking Austronesian languages.</p>
                <p>These Austronesian peoples seem to have migrated from South China, probably through the Philippines and
                    Sulawesi.
                    Their tools included rectangular adzes and red slipped decorated pottery.</p>
               <img src="/assets/img/bali-history-2.jpg" class="featured-image" alt="bali history">
                <p>Forests and jungles were cleared for the establishment of cultures and villages.They also made some plaited
                    craft and
                    a small boat was also found.</p>
                <p>Their culinary habits included pork-eating and betel-chewing. They are thought to have focused on mountain
                    cults.
                </p>
                <p>They buried some of their more prestigious dead in oval stone sarcophagi, with human heads or zoomorphic
                    figures
                    sculpted on them. The bodies were either deposited in the sleeping position, or folded in two or three for
                    compactness.</p>
                <p>An important neolithic archaeological site in Bali is that of Cekik, in the western part of the island.
                </p>
                <p>These same Austronesian people are thought to have continued their expansion eastward, to occupy Melanesian
                    and
                    Polynesian islands around 2000 years ago.</p>
                <p>The cultural traits of this period are still clearly visible in the culture of Bali today, and connect it to
                    the
                    cultures of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                <h4>Bronze Age: arrival of Dong Son culture (600 BCE-800 CE)</h4>
                <p>A Bronze Age period follows, from around 600 BCE to 800 CE. Between the 8th and 3rd century BCE, the island
                    of Bali
                    acquired the "Dong Son" metallurgical techniques spreading from Northern Vietnam.
                </p>
                <p>These techniques involved sophisticated casting from moulds, with spiral and anthropomorphic motifs.
                </p>
                <img src="/assets/img/bali-history-3.jpg" class="featured-image" alt="dong son culture">
                <p>As mould fragments have been found in the area of Manuaba in Bali, it is thought that such implements were
                    manufactured locally rather than imported. </p>
                <p>The raw material to make bronze (copper and tin) had to be imported however, as it is not available on Bali.
                </p>
                <p>Numerous bronze tools and weapons were made (axes, cooking tools, jewellery), and ceremonial drums from that
                    period
                    are also found in abundance, such as the "Moon of Pejeng", the largest ceremonial drum yet found in
                    Southeast Asia,
                    dated to around
                    300 BCE.</p>
                <p>The stone sarcophagi were still in use during that period, as bronze artefacts were also found in them.
                </p>
                <h4>Ancient historical period: Indianized kingdoms (800-1343 CE)</h4>
                <p>The ancient historical period is defined by the appearance of the first written records in Bali, in the form
                    of clay
                    pallets with Buddhist inscriptions. </p>
                <p>These Buddhist inscriptions, found in small clay stupa figurines (called "stupikas") are the first known
                    written
                    inscriptions in Bali and date from around the 8th century CE.</p>
                <p>Such stupikas have been found in the regency of Gianyar, in the villages of Pejeng, Tatiapi and Blahbatuh.
                </p>
                <p>This period is generally closely associated with the arrival and expansion of Buddhism and Hinduism in the
                    island of
                    Bali. </p>
                <p>The Belanjong pillar ("Prasasti Blanjong") in southern Sanur was inscribed in 914 with the mention of the
                    reign of
                    the Balinese king Sri Kesari. </p>
                <p>It is written in both the Indian Sanskrit language and Old Balinese language, using two scripts, the Nagari
                    script
                    and the Old Balinese script (which is used to write both Balinese and Sanskrit).</p>
                <p>The pillar testifies to the connections of Bali with the Sanjaya Dynasty in Central Java. It is dated
                    according to
                    the Indian Shaka calendar. </p>
                <p>According to the inscription, Sri Kesari was a Buddhist king of the Sailendra Dynasty leading a military
                    expedition,
                    to establish a Mahayana Buddhist government in Bali.</p>
                <p> The stone temple of Goa Gajah was made around the same period, and shows a combination of Buddhist and Hindu
                    (Shivaite) iconography. </p>
                <img src="/assets/img/bali-history-4.jpg" class="featured-image" alt="goa gajah">
                <center><u>Goa Gajah in Bali, Indonesia)</u></center>
                <p></p>
                <p>Inter-marriages between Java and Bali royalty also occurred, as when king Udayana Warmadewa of the Warmadewa
                    dynasty
                    of Bali married a Javanese princess, sister of the Emperor of Java Dharmawangsa.
                </p>
                <p>Their son became the great ruler of East Java Airlangga, who ruled on both Java and Bali. In the 12th
                    century,
                    descendant of Airlangga are also known to have ruled over Bali, such as Jayasakti (1146–50) and Jayapangus
                    (1178–81).</p>
                <p>The island of Java again started to encroach significantly on Bali with the invasion of Singarasi king
                    Kertanegara in
                    1284. </p>
                <p>Kertanegara was then toppled by Raden Wijaya, founder of the Majapahit Empire. Contacts with China were also
                    important during this period. Chinese coins, called Kepeng were in use in Bali from the 7th century. </p>
                <p>The traditional Barong is also thought to be derived from the Chinese dragon. In the 12th century, king
                    Jayapangus of
                    Bali is known to have married a Chinese princess.</p>
                <h4>Middle historical period: Majapahit dynastic rule (1343-1846)</h4>
                <p>The Majapahit Empire rule over Bali became complete when Gajah Mada, Prime Minister of the Javanese king,
                    defeated
                    the Balinese king in Bedulu in 1343.</p>
                <p>The Majapahit capital in Bali was established at Samprangan and later Gelgel. Gelgel remained the paramount
                    kingdom
                    on Bali until the second half of the 17th century. </p>
                <img src="/assets/img/bali-history-5.jpg" class="featured-image" alt="bali history">
                <p>The rule of the Majapahit marks the strong influx of Javanese culture into Bali, most of all in architecture,
                    dance
                    and the theatre, in literature with the introduction of the Kawi script, in painting and sculpture and the
                    wayang
                    puppet theatre.
                </p>
                <p>The few Balinese who did not adopt this culture are still known today as "Bali Aga" ("Original Balinese") and
                    still
                    live in a few isolated villages. </p>
                <p>With the rise of Islam in the Indonesian archipelago, the Majapahit empire finally fell, and Bali became
                    independent
                    at the end of the 15th or beginning of the 16th century. </p>
                <p>According to some myth the Javanese aristocracy fled to Bali, bringing an even stronger influx of Hindu arts,
                    literature and religion. </p>
                <p>According to later chronicles the dynasty of Majapahit origins, established after 1343, continued to rule
                    Bali for 5
                    more centuries until 1908, when the Dutch eliminated it in the Dutch intervention in Bali (1908). </p>
                <p>In the 16th century, the Balinese king Dalem Baturenggong even expanded in turn his rule to East Java, Lombok
                    and
                    western Sumbawa. </p>
                <p>Around 1540, together with the Islamic advance, a Hindu reformation movement took place, led by Dang Hyang
                    Nirartha,
                    leading to the introduction of the Padmasana shrine in honour of the "Supreme God" Acintya, and the
                    establishment of
                    the present shape
                    of Shiva-worshipping in Bali. </p>
                <p>Nirartha also established numerous temples, including the spectacular temple at Uluwatu.</p>
        
                <p>In ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed, namely Pasupata, Bhairawa, Siwa Shidanta, Waisnawa, Bodha, Brahma,
                    Resi,
                    Sora and Ganapatya. Each sect revered a specific deity as its personal Godhead. </p>
                <p>Inscriptions from 896 and 911 do not mention a king, until 914, when Sri Kesarivarma is mentioned. They also
                    reveal
                    an independent Bali, with a distinct dialect, where Buddhism and Sivaism were practiced simultaneously. </p>
                <p>Mpu Sindok's great-granddaughter, Mahendradatta (Gunapriyadharmapatni), married the Bali king Udayana
                    Warmadewa
                    (Dharmodayanavarmadeva) around 989, giving birth to Airlangga around 1001.
                </p>
                <p>This marriage also brought more Hinduism and Javanese culture to Bali. Princess Sakalendukirana appeared in
                    1098.
                    Suradhipa reigned from 1115 to 1119, and Jayasakti from 1146 until 1150. </p>
                <p>Jayapangus appears on inscriptions between 1178 and 1181, while Adikuntiketana and his son Paramesvara in
                    1204.</p>
                <p>Balinese culture was strongly influenced by Indian, Chinese, and particularly Hindu culture, beginning around
                    the 1st
                    century AD. </p>
                <p>The name Bali dwipa ("Bali island") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong
                    pillar
                    inscription written by Sri Kesari Warmadewa in 914 AD and mentioning Walidwipa.
                </p>
                <p>It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system subak to grow rice in
                    wet-field
                    cultivation. Some religious and cultural traditions still practiced today can be traced to this period.</p>
                <p>The Hindu Majapahit Empire(1293–1520 AD) on eastern Java founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of
                    Hayam Wuruk
                    is mentioned in the charters of 1384–86. </p>
                <p>A mass Javanese immigration to Bali occurred in the next century when the Majapahit Empire fell in 1520.</p>
                <p>Bali's government then became an independent collection of Hindu kingdoms which led to a Balinese national
                    identity
                    and major enhancements in culture, arts, and economy. </p>
                <p>The nation with various kingdoms became independent for up to 386 years until 1906, when the Dutch subjugated
                    and
                    repulsed the natives for economic control and took it over.</p>
                <h4>European contacts</h4>
                <p>The first direct or indirect news of Bali by some European travelers can be traced back to Marco Polo and
                    other
                    possible travelers and traders via the Mediterranean Sea and Asia.</p>
                <p>The first known European contact with Bali is thought to have been made in 1512, when a Portuguese expedition
                    led by
                    Antonio Abreu and Francisco Serrão reached its northern coast. </p>
                <p>It was the first expedition of a series of biannual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century
                    usually
                    traveled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands. </p>
                <p>Bali was also mapped in 1512, in the chart of Francisco Rodrigues, aboard the expedition. </p>
                <p>The Magellan expedition (1519–1522), through Elcano, is thought to have possibly sighted the island, and
                    early
                    Portuguese and Spanish charts mention the island under various names such as Boly, Bale and Bally.</p>
                <p>Sir Francis Drake briefly visited the island in 1580. In 1585, the Portuguese government in Malacca sent a
                    ship to
                    establish a fort and a trading post in Bali, but the ship foundered on the reef of the Bukit peninsula and
                    only five
                    survivors could
                    make it ashore.</p>
                <p>They went into the service of the king of Gelgel, known as the Dalem, and were provided with wives and homes.
                    In
                    1597, the Dutch explorer Cornelis de Houtman arrived in Bali with 89 surviving men (out of 249 who had
                    departed).
                </p>
                <p>After visits to Kuta and Jembrana, he assembled his fleet in Padang Bai. Enthusiastic, he christened the
                    island
                    "Young Holland" (Jonck Hollandt). </p>
                <p>They were able to meet with the Dalem, who produced for them one of the Portuguese who had been in his
                    service since
                    1585, Pedro de Noronha.</p>
                <h4>Bali Indonesian Independence</h4>
                <p>Imperial Japan occupied Bali during World War II with the declared objective of forming a "Greater East Asian
                    Co-Prosperity Sphere" that would liberate Asian countries from Western domination. </p>
                <p>The harshness of war requisitions made Japanese rule more resented than Dutch rule. Most of all, independence
                    was
                    strongly desired among the populace.</p>
                <p> Following Japan's Pacific surrender in August 1945, the Balinese took over the Japanese weapons. The Dutch
                    returned
                    to Indonesia in 1946, including Bali, to reinstate their pre-war colonial administration. </p>

                <p></p>
                <p>One Balinese, Colonel Gusti Ngurah Rai, formed a Balinese 'freedom army'. Colonel I Gusti Ngurah Rai, by then
                    29
                    years old, rallied his forces in east Bali at Marga Rana, where they were trapped by heavily armed Dutch
                    troops.
                </p>
                <p>On 20 November 1946, in the Battle of Marga, the Balinese battalion was entirely wiped out, breaking the last
                    thread
                    of Balinese military resistance. </p>
                <p>In 1946 the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed State of
                    East
                    Indonesia, a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia which was proclaimed and headed by Sukarno and Hatta.
                </p>
                <p>Bali was included in the United States of Indonesia when the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence
                    on 29
                    December 1949. </p>
                <p>The first governor of Bali, Anak Agung Bagus Suteja, was appointed by President Sukarno in 1958, when Bali
                    became a
                    province.</p>
