                <h3 style="text-align: left;">6 Best Things to Do in Bali</h3>
                <p>The best things to do in Bali include not-to-be-missed cultural treasures and some of the most iconic landmarks and landscapes that you can find around this magical island. There are innumerable temples, historical sites, and spots of
                    natural beauty spread across Bali’s 8 regencies, which were formerly kingdoms. </p>
                <p>From Bali’s scenic vistas to exotic cultural performances, this compilation of great things to see and do in Bali will help you discover the best the island has to offer. Go east to see the majestic 'mother temple' and magnificent royal
                    water palaces or travel to the island’s lush interior where rice paddies offer scenic photo opportunities.</p>
                <h4>Tanah Lot Temple in Bali</h4>
                <p>Tanah Lot Temple is one of Bali’s most important landmarks, which is famed for its unique offshore setting and sunset backdrops. An ancient Hindu shrine perched on top of an outcrop amidst constantly crashing waves; Tanah Lot Temple is
                    simply among Bali’s not-to-be-missed icons.</p>
                <p>The onshore site of the Tanah Lot temple complex is dotted with smaller shrines together with visitors’ leisure facilities that comprise restaurants, shops and a cultural park where regular dance performances are shown regularly. The temple
                    is located in the Beraban village of the Tabanan regency, an approximate 20km north-west of Kuta. It is often included on sightseeing and cultural tours to Bali’s western and central regions</p>
                <img src="/assets/img/tanah-lot.jfif" class="featured-image" alt="tanah-lot">
                <h5>Good things to know about Tanah Lot</h5>
                <p>Although the main temple grounds of Tanah Lot are only for praying pilgrims and are closed off to visitors, the panoramic views and cultural offerings around are highlights to enjoy. On the holy day of Kuningan, 5 days prior to the temple’s
                    anniversary, the pilgrimages are festive parades worth witnessing.</p>
                <p>Tanah Lot’s piodalan anniversary falls on a Wednesday following each Kuningan on Bali’s 210-day Pawukon calendar. You must dress and act respectfully as on any temple visit in Bali. Large waves near the rocks are hazardous. Always take
                    extreme care and obey warning signs. For further safety measures, members of the Balawista lifeguards take shifts to lend a watchful eye at several key points along the coast.</p>
                <p>On combined day tours, try reaching Tanah Lot in the early afternoon to explore the site, then head on to the Surya Mandala Cultural Park’s grand open stage near Batu Bolong to see the sunset Kecak ‘fire dance’ performances (held daily
                    from 6.30pm), then stay on for dinner at one of the restaurants on Sunset Terrace. There are Western and Asian selections, but Bali’s favourite spicy sauced grills and seafood are must-tries – paired with ice-cold beers and views of
                    the temple.</p>
                <h4>Uluwatu Temple in Bali</h4>
                <p>Uluwatu Temple, or Pura Luhur Uluwatu, is renowned for its magnificent location, perched on top of a steep cliff approximately 70 metres above the waves. As one of the 6 key temples considered to be Bali's 'spiritual pillars', Uluwatu
                    also shares the splendid sunset backdrops as that of Tanah Lot Temple, another important sea temple that graces the island's western coast.</p>
                <p>Pura Luhur Uluwatu is definitely one of the top places in Bali for witnessing a delightful sunset, with direct views overlooking the beautiful waves of the Indian Ocean and daily Kecak dance performances held at an amphitheatre nearby.
                    Balinese architecture, traditionally-designed gateways, and ancient sculptures all add to Uluwatu Temple's appeal.</p>
                <img src="/assets/img/tanah-lot.jfif" class="featured-image" alt="tanah-lot">
                <h5>Good to know about Uluwatu Temple</h5>
                <p>Precautionary signs warn visitors of the resident macaques habitually grabbing attractive items such as sunglasses and cameras. They can be calmer when approached with peanuts or bananas, though, lending you an opportunity to retake stolen
                    possessions
                </p>
                <p>As a visitor, you must wear a sarong and a sash, which can be hired at the temple entrance. The best time to visit is just before sunset. A Kecak dance is performed every day at the adjacent cliff-top stage from 6pm and usually last an
                    hour. What makes it the most favourite venue to watch a Kecak dance is the sunset background of the performance.</p>
                <p>There's no public transportation to get to Uluwatu Temple and going back into town will be difficult without any prearranged ride or taxi. A guide is not necessary but can be helpful.</p>
                <h4>Ubud Monkey Forest in Bali</h4>
                <p>The Ubud Monkey Forest is home to over 700 grey long-tailed macaques. Also known as the Sacred Monkey Forest of Padangtegal, this natural sanctuary has paved pathways through a leafy nutmeg forest as well as several ancient temples under
                    dense foliage. It’s a popular wildlife reserve in Bali thanks to its community-based management, location and ease of access.</p>
                <img src="/assets/img/monkey-forest-1.jfif" class="featured-image" alt="monkey-forest">
                <h5>What to see at Ubud Monkey Forest</h5>
                <p>The Ubud Monkey Forest is known for its conservation efforts. Research and studies are regularly carried out for observing the monkeys’ health, diet and breeding habits. You can see these playful primates in their natural habitat, swinging
                    through canopies, and feeding on bananas.</p>
                <p>The forest also has several ancient temples with guardian statues covered in moss. Popular sites include the 14th-century Pura Dalem Agung Padangtegal and Pura Prajapati, which is dedicated to village funerals. Relics and statues are under
                    dense foliage with little sunlight, resulting in a mysterious and ancient vibe.</p>
                <p>Banyan tree roots hanging over shadowy dragon staircases offer exotic photo opportunities. You can also find Pura Beji, an ancient bathing temple located northwest of the main site of Ubud Monkey Forest.</p>
                <h4>Kintamani</h4>
                <p>Kintamani is a mountain village in central Bali that’s home to Mount Batur, which is Bali’s second tallest peak, and the Batur caldera lake. The village is located in the Karangasem regency in east Bali and is a popular spot for sightseeing
                    thanks to vantage points such as Penelokan, which aptly means 'scenic stopover'. Penelokan is the best site for panoramic views, with Batur's rugged features of dark lava slopes and black molten rocks in view. The still-active Mount
                    Batur volcano erupted about 24 times since 1800, each time reshaping the surrounding landscape. It’s popular among mountain hikers, with the early sunrises from the ridges being its highlight</p>
                <img src="/assets/img/kintamani.jfif" class="featured-image" alt="kintamani">
                <h4>Best Traditional Dance Shows in Bali</h4>
                <p>Traditional dance shows in Bali allow you to enjoy some of the island’s most alluring visual treats. There’s a good mix of dance and drama, with live performances mostly presented on dedicated stages and amphitheatres – some being part
                    of restaurants offering cultural dinners. You can admire barong and kris performances, kecak dances, and eloquent legong and joged dancers in vivid costumes.
                </p>
                <p>Shows are held regularly and some feature different line-ups of events throughout the week, adding to the variety of colourful highlights that you can appreciate on your next bookings. Keep these great restaurants and venues in check whenever
                    you’re feeling peckish and wish to please your inner arts and culture buff.</p>

                <p>The most popular beaches in Bali attract travellers with their impressive landscape, clear waters, and a wide range of activities. There are rocky shores under towering limestone cliffs and long, palm-lined coastlines, as well as some
